title: Communication Platforms

Right now, I'm actively using Slack, Discord, Messenger, and Matrix (through
Element). I'd like to combine them all into one unified messaging system,
possibly to sacrifice some of the features of each. But because many of these
technologies are proprietary, it is incredibly difficult to get them to play
nicely.

My best attempt has been actually through IRC, using BitlBee to provide me with
Discord and Messenger integration. However, a frontend like IRC is very limited
in its capabilities. For example, I cannot view replies nor reactions on Discord,
which can make conversation more annoying.

I would love for Matrix to gain more popularity. I think that decentralized
communication could give great benefits, especially with what has recently been
happening in the political atmosphere.
