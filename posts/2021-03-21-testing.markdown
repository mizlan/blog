## Testing out some codeblocks.

Below is some python code:

```python
import math
print(math.factorial(3))

# print out the numbers from 0 to 9.
# NOTE: not from 1 to 10!
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
```

Below is some C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "hi" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Below is some Haskell code:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- prints "hi" to the screen
  putStrLn "hi"
```

Below is some Clojure code:

```clojure
(->> #(rand-int 6)
     repeatedly
     (take 10)
     frequencies)
;; => {5 2, 1 3, 0 2, 2 1, 4 2}
```
