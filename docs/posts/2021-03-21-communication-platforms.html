        <p>Right now, I’m actively using Slack, Discord, Messenger, and Matrix (through Element). I’d like to combine them all into one unified messaging system, possibly to sacrifice some of the features of each. But because many of these technologies are proprietary, it is incredibly difficult to get them to play nicely.</p>
<p>My best attempt has been actually through IRC, using BitlBee to provide me with Discord and Messenger integration. However, a frontend like IRC is very limited in its capabilities. For example, I cannot view replies nor reactions on Discord, which can make conversation more annoying.</p>
<p>I would love for Matrix to gain more popularity. I think that decentralized communication could give great benefits, especially with what has recently been happening in the political atmosphere.</p>
